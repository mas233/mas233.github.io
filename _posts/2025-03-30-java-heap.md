# Heap in Java
For definition of **heap** or **priority queue**, please refer to [Heap]({% post_url 2025-03-29-heap %}). 

Heap is implemented in `java.util`. The class is named as `PriorityQueue` supposedly for application purposes. 

```java
/**
 * An unbounded priority {@linkplain Queue queue} based on a priority heap.
 * The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their
 * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering}, or by a {@link Comparator}
 * provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is
 * used.  A priority queue does not permit {@code null} elements.
 * A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit
 * insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in
 * {@code ClassCastException}).
 *
 * <p>The <em>head</em> of this queue is the <em>least</em> element
 * with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are
 * tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are
 * broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations {@code poll},
 * {@code remove}, {@code peek}, and {@code element} access the
 * element at the head of the queue.
 *
 * <p>A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal
 * <i>capacity</i> governing the size of an array used to store the
 * elements on the queue.  It is always at least as large as the queue
 * size.  As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity
 * grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 * specified.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
 * #iterator()} and the Spliterator provided in method {@link #spliterator()}
 * are <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
 * the priority queue in any particular order. If you need ordered
 * traversal, consider using {@code Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * Multiple threads should not access a {@code PriorityQueue}
 * instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the queue.
 * Instead, use the thread-safe {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue} class.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: this implementation provides
 * O(log(n)) time for the enqueuing and dequeuing methods
 * ({@code offer}, {@code poll}, {@code remove()} and {@code add});
 * linear time for the {@code remove(Object)} and {@code contains(Object)}
 * methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods
 * ({@code peek}, {@code element}, and {@code size}).
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
 *
 * @since 1.5
 * @author Josh Bloch, Doug Lea
 * @param <E> the type of elements held in this queue

```

The Java code blocks in this article are from jdk-17.

# 1 Core Methods
Java's **Priority Queue** use template to store instances of any class. The Priority Queue is implemented with **min heap**, meaning the top of the heap stores the element with the **least value** or priority.
## 1.1 Object Storage
Objects are stored in an array:

```java
/**
 * Priority queue represented as a balanced binary heap: the two
 * children of queue[n] are queue[2*n+1] and queue[2*(n+1)].  The
 * priority queue is ordered by comparator, or by the elements'
 * natural ordering, if comparator is null: For each node n in the
 * heap and each descendant d of n, n <= d.  The element with the
 * lowest value is in queue[0], assuming the queue is nonempty.
 */
transient Object[] queue; // non-private to simplify nested class access
```
Elements will be stored in this array. When the array is full, `grow()` is called to expand the array:

```java
/**
 * Increases the capacity of the array.
 *
 * @param minCapacity the desired minimum capacity
 */
private void grow(int minCapacity) {
    int oldCapacity = queue.length;
    // Double size if small; else grow by 50%
    int newCapacity = ArraysSupport.newLength(oldCapacity,
            minCapacity - oldCapacity, /* minimum growth */
            oldCapacity < 64 ? oldCapacity + 2 : oldCapacity >> 1
                                        /* preferred growth */);
    queue = Arrays.copyOf(queue, newCapacity);
}
```

`newCapacity` is calculated in an overflow-safe way. If JVM has enough space, preferred length will be returned; otherwise minimum growth will be returned. `OutOfMemoryError` will be thrown only if there's not enough space even for the minimum growth.


## 1.2 siftUp
Because `PriorityQueue` supports customized comparing method, `siftUp()` is implemented as such:

```java
/**
 * Inserts item x at position k, maintaining heap invariant by
 * promoting x up the tree until it is greater than or equal to
 * its parent, or is the root.
 *
 * To simplify and speed up coercions and comparisons, the
 * Comparable and Comparator versions are separated into different
 * methods that are otherwise identical. (Similarly for siftDown.)
 *
 * @param k the position to fill
 * @param x the item to insert
 */
private void siftUp(int k, E x) {
    if (comparator != null)
        siftUpUsingComparator(k, x, queue, comparator);
    else
        siftUpComparable(k, x, queue);
}
```

### 1.2.1 siftUpComparable
This method is implemented exactly as mentioned in [Heap]({% post_url 2025-03-29-heap %}). **\>\>\>** operator is used for better performance.
```java
private static <T> void siftUpComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es) {
    Comparable<? super T> key = (Comparable<? super T>) x;
    while (k > 0) {
        int parent = (k - 1) >>> 1;
        Object e = es[parent];
        if (key.compareTo((T) e) >= 0)
            break;
        es[k] = e;
        k = parent;
    }
    es[k] = key;
}
```
### 1.2.2 siftUpUsingComparator
The only difference is the comparing line. Other lines are identical as those in `siftUpComparable()`.
```java
private static <T> void siftUpUsingComparator(
    int k, T x, Object[] es, Comparator<? super T> cmp) {
    while (k > 0) {
        int parent = (k - 1) >>> 1;
        Object e = es[parent];
        if (cmp.compare(x, (T) e) >= 0)
            break;
        es[k] = e;
        k = parent;
    }
    es[k] = x;
}
```

## 1.3 siftDown
Like `siftUp()`, `siftDown()` supports customized comparator as well. 
``` java
/**
 * Inserts item x at position k, maintaining heap invariant by
 * demoting x down the tree repeatedly until it is less than or
 * equal to its children or is a leaf.
 *
 * @param k the position to fill
 * @param x the item to insert
 */
private void siftDown(int k, E x) {
    if (comparator != null)
        siftDownUsingComparator(k, x, queue, size, comparator);
    else
        siftDownComparable(k, x, queue, size);
}
```
Let's only take a look at `siftDownComparable()`:
```java
private static <T> void siftDownComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es, int n) {
    // assert n > 0;
    Comparable<? super T> key = (Comparable<? super T>)x;
    int half = n >>> 1;           // loop while a non-leaf
    while (k < half) {
        int child = (k << 1) + 1; // assume left child is least
        Object c = es[child];
        int right = child + 1;
        if (right < n &&
            ((Comparable<? super T>) c).compareTo((T) es[right]) > 0)
            c = es[child = right];
        if (key.compareTo((T) c) <= 0)
            break;
        es[k] = c;
        k = child;
    }
    es[k] = key;
}
```

Each iteration first assume the left child is least, and then compare it to the right child. If the right child is less, assign it to the local variable `c`(the least child element) and `child`(the least child index).

## 1.4 heapify
This method is implemented as mentioned in [Heap]({% post_url 2025-03-29-heap %}) as well:

```java
/**
 * Establishes the heap invariant (described above) in the entire tree,
 * assuming nothing about the order of the elements prior to the call.
 * This classic algorithm due to Floyd (1964) is known to be O(size).
 */
private void heapify() {
    final Object[] es = queue;
    int n = size, i = (n >>> 1) - 1;
    final Comparator<? super E> cmp;
    if ((cmp = comparator) == null)
        for (; i >= 0; i--)
            siftDownComparable(i, (E) es[i], es, n);
    else
        for (; i >= 0; i--)
            siftDownUsingComparator(i, (E) es[i], es, n, cmp);
}
```
The time complexity of $O(size)$ is also proven in [Heap]({% post_url 2025-03-29-heap %}). 

# 2 Other Methods
Apart from the core methods, this class also provides other useful methods. We will discuss some of them below.

## 2.1 bulkRemove()
This method takes an argument `filter` as input, removing all the elements filtered by this argument. Note that this is a private method. The exposed interface is `removeIf()`, `removeAll()` and `retainAll()`.

```java
/** Implementation of bulk remove methods. */
private boolean bulkRemove(Predicate<? super E> filter) {
    ...
}

/**
 * @throws NullPointerException {@inheritDoc}
 */
public boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(filter);
    return bulkRemove(filter);
}

/**
 * @throws NullPointerException {@inheritDoc}
 */
public boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(c);
    return bulkRemove(e -> c.contains(e));
}

/**
 * @throws NullPointerException {@inheritDoc}
 */
public boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(c);
    return bulkRemove(e -> !c.contains(e));
}
```

The method first scans the whole array to check whether there is **no matching element**.

```java
private boolean bulkRemove(Predicate<? super E> filter) {
    final int expectedModCount = ++modCount;
    final Object[] es = queue;
    final int end = size;
    int i;
    // Optimize for initial run of survivors
    for (i = 0; i < end && !filter.test((E) es[i]); i++)
        ;
    if (i >= end) {
        if (modCount != expectedModCount)
            throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
        return false;
    }
    ...
}
```

> `modCount` is a member used for concurrency scenarios. We will come to that later. 
{: .prompt-info }

 Then the indices of matching elements are stored in a **bitmap**. 

 ```java
    // Tolerate predicates that reentrantly access the collection for
    // read (but writers still get CME), so traverse once to find
    // elements to delete, a second pass to physically expunge.
    final int beg = i;
    final long[] deathRow = nBits(end - beg);
    deathRow[0] = 1L;   // set bit 0
    for (i = beg + 1; i < end; i++)
        if (filter.test((E) es[i]))
            setBit(deathRow, i - beg);
    if (modCount != expectedModCount)
        throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
 ```

[**Fast and Slow Pointers**](https://www.google.com/search?q=fast+and+slow+pointers+pattern) is then used for removing: The fast pointer seeks for the unmatching elements after the first matching index `beg`, while the slow marks the matching elements. If there is no matching element, the slow pointer `w` will always equals the fast pointer `i`. When they reach a matching element, `w` pauses to mark its index and `i` continues. This mechanism allows the remaining unmatching elements will be moved to the "hollows" in the front and only takes one scan.

```java
...
    int w = beg;
        for (i = beg; i < end; i++)
            if (isClear(deathRow, i - beg))
                es[w++] = es[i];
...
```

To this point, the fast pointer `i` has reached the end of the array, and `w` is pointing to the next index of **newSize-1**. So the elements after `w` are then purged and the `size` member is reset.

```java
...
for (i = size = w; i < end; i++)
    es[i] = null;
...
```
At last, `heapify()` is called to ensure the rest of the collection makes a heap. Here's the code of the whole method:

```java
/** Implementation of bulk remove methods. */
private boolean bulkRemove(Predicate<? super E> filter) {
    final int expectedModCount = ++modCount;
    final Object[] es = queue;
    final int end = size;
    int i;
    // Optimize for initial run of survivors
    for (i = 0; i < end && !filter.test((E) es[i]); i++)
        ;
    if (i >= end) {
        if (modCount != expectedModCount)
            throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
        return false;
    }
    // Tolerate predicates that reentrantly access the collection for
    // read (but writers still get CME), so traverse once to find
    // elements to delete, a second pass to physically expunge.
    final int beg = i;
    final long[] deathRow = nBits(end - beg);
    deathRow[0] = 1L;   // set bit 0
    for (i = beg + 1; i < end; i++)
        if (filter.test((E) es[i]))
            setBit(deathRow, i - beg);
    if (modCount != expectedModCount)
        throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
    int w = beg;
    for (i = beg; i < end; i++)
        if (isClear(deathRow, i - beg))
            es[w++] = es[i];
    for (i = size = w; i < end; i++)
        es[i] = null;
    heapify();
    return true;
}
```

## 2.2 contains()

```java
/**
     * Returns {@code true} if this queue contains the specified element.
     * More formally, returns {@code true} if and only if this queue contains
     * at least one element {@code e} such that {@code o.equals(e)}.
     *
     * @param o object to be checked for containment in this queue
     * @return {@code true} if this queue contains the specified element
     */
    public boolean contains(Object o) {
        ...
    }
```

This method checks whether the heap contains an element. The method runs at $O(n)$ because there is no index used in this class. This also shows that it is not advised to search for an item in a `Priority Queue`. Other data structures like `BinarySearchTree` or `HashMap` should be used for these requirements.

```java

public boolean contains(Object o) {
    return indexOf(o) >= 0;
}

private int indexOf(Object o) {
    if (o != null) {
        final Object[] es = queue;
        for (int i = 0, n = size; i < n; i++)
            if (o.equals(es[i]))
                return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

# 3 Designs

## 3.1 Concurrency-safe
This class uses a member `modCount` to ensure thread safety:

```java
/**
     * The number of times this priority queue has been
     * <i>structurally modified</i>.  See AbstractList for gory details.
     */
    transient int modCount;     // non-private to simplify nested class access
```

Every time the element in the array changes, including **adding element** and **removing element**, the `modCount` will be added for version check. So methods involving reading or writing will first mark the right version of modCount. If the expected version doesn't match the current `modCount`, it means the array is modified during the read/write process and thus throws an `ConcurrentModificationException`. \\
Example method `forEach` :

```java
/**
 * @throws NullPointerException {@inheritDoc}
 */
public void forEach(Consumer<? super E> action) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(action);
    final int expectedModCount = modCount;
    final Object[] es = queue;
    for (int i = 0, n = size; i < n; i++)
        action.accept((E) es[i]);
    if (expectedModCount != modCount)
        throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
}
```

## 3.2 Object Oriented
Java being an Object Oriented language, class `PriorityQueue` reflects many of its features, such as **template class**, **inheritance** and **implementation**.

```java
public class PriorityQueue<E> extends AbstractQueue<E>
    implements java.io.Serializable
```
### 3.2.1 Serializable
Classes implementing this interface can be serialized by JDK for IO transmission. This means this class is verified by Java to be safe to be transformed into/from byte array. The class declares its `serialVersion` to serialize/deserialize the correct version of objects:

```java
...
@java.io.Serial
private static final long serialVersionUID = -7720805057305804111L;
...
```

### 3.2.2 AbstractQueue
`PriorityQueue` has a hierarchy of inheritance:
![PriorityQueueDependencyDiagram](assets/img/post-imgs/java-heap/1.png)
_Inheritance Hieraychy of PriorityQueue_
- `Iterable` is an interface of which the implementation class can be the target of the **enhanced *for* statement**. Example:
    ```java
        Iterable<Object> t = new ArrayList<>();
        for(Object o:t){
            action.accept(o);
        }
    ```
- `Collection` represents a group of objects. This interface is used for maximum generality to move specific implementations around, such as **List**, **Set**, etc.
- `AbstractCollection` provides a skeletal implementation of `Collection` interface by implementing its non-modifying methods like `isEmpty()`, `contains()` and `toArray()`.
- `Queue` typically order elements in a **FIFO**(first-in-first-out) way but not always. PriorityQueue is an exception. `Queue` provides basic interfaces `add()`,`offer()`,`poll()`,`remove()`, `element()` and `peek()`. The pairs of similar methods differ only in return values -  `add()`, `remove()` and `element()` will throw an exception if operation fails, while their pair method returns null or false. 
- `AbstractQueue` provides skeletal implementations of `Queue`
